Hi! My name is T-Bot. It is a great pleasure and an honor to meet you!
I have no memory of human faces, so if our paths have already crossed in the Aurora app, Iâ€™m glad to see you again!
";

const MSG_2: &str = "
I'm kind of like Gandalf, Dumbledore or Obi-Wan Kenobi. You know, the guy who makes sure the novice gets to a certain destination. Spoiler alert: in this saga the guide will survive. Regardless of whether this is your first contact with cryptocurrencies or you are advanced in it, I will stay with you until the Tari Launchpad setup process is successfully completed.

So let's get started! ðŸš€ The setup process usually takes 5 to 10 minutes. A duo like you and me should be able to deal with it quickly, right?
